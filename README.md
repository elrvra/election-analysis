#PyPoll with Python

##Overview of Election Audit

###Explain the purpose of this election audit.
The purpose of this election audit is to assist a Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom in an election audit of the tabulated results for US Congressional Precenting in Colorado. The task is to report the total of number of votes cast, the total number of votes for each candidate and county, the percentage of votes for each candidate and county and the winner of the election based on the popular vote as well as the county with the largest number of votes. 

This task is usually done in excel, but Tom’s manager wants to know if there is a way to automate the process using Python. If this audit is done successful with Python, the code Tom and I write will be used to audit not only other congressional districts but also senatorial districts and local election. There are three primary voting methods that you and Tom will take into account: mail in ballots, punch cards, and direct reporting electronic (DRE) copy machines. Mail in ballots is typically hand counted at the central office. Punch cards are collected and fed into a machine that tabulates the totals and sends results to central office. Memory cards for DRE counting machines are sent to the central office and read by computers. 

All together the votes cast by these three methods will determine the final election results. After the votes are counted, my job is to generate a vote count report to certify this US Congressional race. I will be using Python to write algorithms that will assist the confirmation and analysis of election results by using the provided .csv file that houses the election data.

##Election Audit Results

###Using a bulleted list, address the following election outcomes. Use images or examples of your code as support where necessary. 
1) How many votes were cast in this congressional election?
2) Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of total votes for each county in the precinct.
3) Which county had the largest number of votes?
4) Provide a breakdown of the number of votes and the percentage of the total votes each candidate received.
5) Which candidate won the election, what was their vote count, and what was their percentage of the total votes?


##Election Audity Summary

###In a summary statement, provide a business proposal to the election commission on how this script can be used—with some modifications—for any election. Give at least two examples of how this script can be modified to be used for other elections.
